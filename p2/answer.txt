In most cases where I dont need to directly handle joining the threads, having the additional layer of abstraction makes the code easier to understand, and safer when handling exceptions.

To ensure the destructors are run and the threads are joined, I only need to encapsulate the threaded section in a block, which is intuitive and simple.
